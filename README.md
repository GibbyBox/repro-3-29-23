# Goal

Define a reusable friends screen for both the feed and profile tabs that we can navigate to within those tab stacks.

Similar to twitter and instagram where a user can be on a tab, navigate into a deeply nested structure, and still remain
on that tab.

Look to branch `attempt/no-array-syntax` as that shows it successfully.
